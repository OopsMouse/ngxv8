This page instructs how to build ngx_v8 module and embed it to Nginx.

= Step 1 : Getting V8 =

You first need to fetch [http://code.google.com/p/v8/ V8 JavaScript Engine] source code and build the library. The V8 project site describes how to do this.

When you finished up the build, you will get the library named "libv8.so" which will be linked from ngx_v8.


= Step 2: Getting Nginx =

You also have to get Nginx source code of course. Download a latest archive from the [http://nginx.net/ Officeal Site].


= Step 3: Getting ngx_v8 =

ngx_v8 source code is hosted on this site. ngx_v8 has only two files: "config" and "ngx_http_v8_module.cc". "config" is a file containing module build information to tell Nginx that it is a module for you. In this file, you need to specify the location of V8. Change the path from my one to your one.

At last, you are in build stage. Like always move Nginx directory, configure, make, and make install as follows. At this time, you have to specify the path to ngx_v8 directory containing "config" and "ngx_http_v8_module.cc" using configure's "--add-module" parameter.
